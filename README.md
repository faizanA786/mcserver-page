## Personal website for server
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2196a0b6-7077-4e66-ba28-47524da9d41a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ourserver/deploys)

I made this website to let players inside my private server have access to a dynamic player display menu that shows who is online and who is not, and be able to see the latest changes to the server. It also contains links to other useful utilities.
